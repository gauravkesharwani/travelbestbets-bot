2023-05-28 08:16:30,208 DEBUG Conversation Chatbot:  Arenal Volcano is located in north-western Costa Rica, around 55 miles of San José, in the province of Alajuela. It is one of the most active volcanoes in the country and in the world, standing at 5,436 feet and is thought to be over 7,000 years old. It recently spewed vapor into the air in 2012, and there are many fun things to do around it such as hiking up to La Fortuna Waterfall, visiting Lake Arenal, and going for a swim in the Arenal Volcano Hot Springs. Visitors should be aware that because the volcano is still active, there is always a chance that something dangerous could happen, though the odds may be slim.

You can let the travel agent know your budget and they can try to work with you based on the amount you give them. The price varies based on where you are going, what you are doing, where you are staying, extras you put onto the trip, and how long you are going to be gone. All of these factors can change the amount you have to pay for the trip. The prices range from $1,499 to $6,999. These prices can also change based on the above factors, so keep this in mind. The prices are all-inclusive, including travel, stay, food, activities, and more.\\n\\nHow much would a tour cost?The tours can range in price depending on where you are going, how long the trip is going to take, and any specifics you want to add to your trip. Make sure that you consider your budget before booking. You can see the price before you choose which way to go. The costs tend to be around $1,500 per day per person with some, but others can be as low as $800 per person per day. Depending on where you are going, you want to consider the prices, the extra costs, the days you are going to be gone, and what they include. Abercrombie & Kent usually include the travel, stay, things to do, and some treats along the way with the price of the tour and guide that you go on.\\n\\nHow much would a tour cost?The costs of the tour can range based on a number of factors. You want to keep this in mind when it comes to booking. Where you are going, what you are doing, and extras are all part of the price since these tours are all-inclusive, so this is something to think about. On average, the tours cost between $1,000 to up to $6,000 for a week to more than a week per person. This is not a bad price when considering that this includes almost everything you would need for the trip.\\n\\nCan I go on a Contiki tour alone?Yes, you\'re more than welcome to go on a Contiki tour alone. In fact, the majority of those who take these tours are going on them alone. They are a younger crowd and they are going to meet new people, experience new things, and make new friends. You might just make one while you are enjoying the time away from home.\\n\\nHuman: where are disney resorts in america?\\nAI:  Adventures by Disney offers unique family vacations in North America, Central & South America, Europe, Africa, Asia Pacific, Polar Regions and Around The World.

You can let the travel agent know your budget and they can try to work with you based on the amount you give them. The price varies based on where you are going, what you are doing, where you are staying, extras you put onto the trip, and how long you are going to be gone. All of these factors can change the amount you have to pay for the trip. The prices range from $1,499 to $6,999. These prices can also change based on the above factors, so keep this in mind. The prices are all-inclusive, including travel, stay, food, activities, and more.\\n\\nHow much would a tour cost?The tours can range in price depending on where you are going, how long the trip is going to take, and any specifics you want to add to your trip. Make sure that you consider your budget before booking. You can see the price before you choose which way to go. The costs tend to be around $1,500 per day per person with some, but others can be as low as $800 per person per day. Depending on where you are going, you want to consider the prices, the extra costs, the days you are going to be gone, and what they include. Abercrombie & Kent usually include the travel, stay, things to do, and some treats along the way with the price of the tour and guide that you go on.\\n\\n\\"Prices for beverages, food, and/or snacks are extremely HIGH! $3 USD for a 12 oz. can of pop OR WATER (16-20 oz) ? ! ! $7 USD for a 5-6 oz bottle of wine ?! The prices are ridiculous!! You can\'t get water to cry with or if you were on fire. Upon viewing your menu, there is a \\"bundle\\" for three or more items. This IS NOT a bargain. You decrease the price by a dollar is nothing. It appears to be overly enrichment and a rip-off. I know that you\'re in business to make a profit. But dayumm!! REALLY??! You all are certainly taking advantage of your customers. There may be either a continued decrease of purchases or none at all. I noticed that there weren\'t many purchases in relation to the number of passengers on board at the time. BTW, the price paid for the single bottle of wine ($7 USD) is what it costs for the 4-pack, if not less. A person can purchase 750 ml or 1/5 gallon for the same amount or less (i.e., $5 USD + tax). This is wrong and obliges passenger to make a grudging purchase out of necessity. Have you ever been thirsty before? Can\'t have water to take medications without spending large amount of money. You can\'t even get tap water or courtesy cup of water / ice. What type of mess is this? $50+ bag check fee is horrendous!! Your competitors are much cheaper. Please add more cushion and room to your seats. Had this flight been more than 90 mins., I\'d be making a trip to the hospital instead of home.\\"\\n\\nHuman: disney resorts in north america?\\nAI:  Disney resorts in North America include Disneyland Resort & Southern California, the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California; Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida; Aulani, a Disney Resort & Spa in Ko Olina, Hawaii; and Disney Cruise Line with sailings departing from ports in California, Florida, Texas, and New York.\\nQuestion: how much do they cost?\\nAnswer:"], "model": "text-davinci-003", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 256, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "n": 1, "logit_bias": {}}' message='Post details'

You can let the travel agent know your budget and they can try to work with you based on the amount you give them. The price varies based on where you are going, what you are doing, where you are staying, extras you put onto the trip, and how long you are going to be gone. All of these factors can change the amount you have to pay for the trip. The prices range from $1,499 to $6,999. These prices can also change based on the above factors, so keep this in mind.

Make sure that you consider your budget before booking. You can see the price before you choose which way to go. The costs tend to be around $1,500 per day per person with some, but others can be as low as $800 per person per day.

Many of those visit our favorite national parks, Death Valley, Joshua Tree, and Yosemite, and many of those end up missing out on what we think are some really neat things. Below are some of the tried-and-true must-dos that we hope you\\u2019ll have time for!\\n\\n1. Meet John Muir\\n\\nCalifornia is one of the most geographically diverse states with its warm beaches, mountains, deserts, and lakes. Spread all through California are the majestic sequoia trees. These trees are a geological wonder with their average height of 286 feet. The Sequoia Forest will make you feel like you\\u2019re in a fairytale! Adjacent to the forest is Death Valley, one of the hottest places in the world. Badwater Basin in Death Valley is covered in a white layer that is often mistaken for snow when in fact, it is salt! This expansive salt flat has the lowest elevation in North America. The National Parks of California await you!\\n\\nThe Grand Canyon\\n\\nHuman: Disney Locations in North America?\\nAI: There are several Disney locations in North America, including Walt Disney World in Florida, Disneyland in California, and Disneyland Paris in France (which is technically located in Europe but is still part of the Disney Parks family). There are also several Disney resorts and hotels located throughout North America.\\nHuman: how much do they cost?\\nAI: The cost of visiting a Disney location can vary greatly depending on several factors such as the time of year, length of stay, type of ticket purchased, and accommodations chosen. It is best to check the official Disney website for specific pricing information based on your individual preferences. As for spending money, it is recommended to bring enough cash or credit for meals, souvenirs, and any additional activities not included in the ticket price. Local currency can typically be obtained at banks, ATMs, or currency exchange offices.\\nHuman: can you give me the website?\\nAI: Certainly!
